# <Prework-Study-Guide>

## Description

I was exposed to coding while on deployment while i was in the Marine corps and discovered it was something i had an interes in leading me to sign up for a Full-stack coding bootcamp. The purpose of this project
was to assist me moving forward in organazing what i've learned and have an easy to reference guide to help in my studies. The project also served as a valuable tool to introduce me to some of the basic concepts that will be used
going forward in the class.
